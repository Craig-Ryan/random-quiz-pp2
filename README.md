## Features

- __Quiz Container__ 

    - The entire quiz game is located within the quiz container.
    - This consists of a h1 title, the question content in a h2 and 4 radio buttons to select from as answers.

    - There is a submit button below the quiz to cycle thru the questions once answered which at the end gives the user the option to play again and shows their final score.

### Features Left to Implement

- This is a very basic quiz done in a rush. If more time were available the quiz answer layout would have been in 2x2 rather than the 4 in a line. In the future I will add social links in a footer below the container.
